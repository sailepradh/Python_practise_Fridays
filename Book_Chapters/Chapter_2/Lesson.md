## Concept regarding Input, Processing and Output

### Designing a program

Typical constitutes of 5 cycles as shown in the figure 1

* Desinging the program
* Write the program
* Correct syntax errors
* Test the program
* Correct logical errors


#### Design process

* Understanding the tast that the program is to perform
    
    
    Multiple sittings to understand the task that a program have to perform
    
    
* Determine the steps that must be performed the tasks

    Sequential receipe like steps in order to execute the objective of the tasks. It may be followed by making some flowcharts and pseudocodes in order to describe the process.
    


### Input, Processing and output 

* Input --> receive some data from keyboared (for example)
* Process --> Do some mathematical calculations 
* Output --> Get the results from the Process to users

### Displaying Output with the _print_ Function

Important concept is the function that would do the necessary processing so that it can do certain predefined operations. Functions are followed by the agrguments that are things that are supposedly processed as in print function it is displayed

### Writing a comment 

Comment out with # to make program understandable

### storing values in variables
